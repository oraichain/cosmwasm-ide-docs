# Github Codespace tutorial

## Free-version Github Codespace

To setup your workspace with all the neccessary tools & libraries for developing the CosmWasm smart contracts, please enter [this Github template](https://github.com/oraichain/cw-ide-codespace-template) to create a new workspace using its pre-configuration file. 

1. Click on the *Use this template* green button.

2. Next, choose *Open in a codespace* option.

Github will setup your codespace automatically with the configuration of the template including Rust installed, and two important extensions: Rust-analyzer - code suggestions; CosmWasm IDE - our extension. The first installation time will take about 500 seconds because the container needs to install some optimization packages of Rust to build small smart contract files. Other than that, you should be able to enter your codespace almost instantly.

After installing, the template will create a minimal CosmWasm contract template for you to get started.
