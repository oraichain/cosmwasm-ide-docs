# Gitpod tutorial

## Free-version Gitpod

To setup your workspace with all the neccessary tools & libraries for developing the CosmWasm smart contracts, please click button ```Open in Gitpod``` below. Gitpod will automatically install everything you need to deploy a smart contract.

## Self-hosted Gitpod

Oraichain team has created a self-hosted Gitpod infrastructure alpha version with Kubenetes. This service is to replace the free version of Gitpod, which unfortunately removes your workspaces after a short period of time.

With this new self-hosted Gitpod, your workspaces can be inactive as long as 14 days, and your changes on such workspaces will be retained. If you pin any workspace, it will stay the same forever. You will also have unlimited hours to help you stay focused on developing awesome contracts!

To start using the self-hosted Gitpod, please visit [this website](https://cwide.io/). Then, you can login using your Github account to start creating new workspaces, which will link to corresponding github repositories that you choose. 

Please note that in order to install the development environment in this way, you need to add the [following file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oraichain/cosmwasm-gitpod/master/.gitpod.yml) into the repository's root location that you want to use on Gitpod.
